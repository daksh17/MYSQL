-- Column Aliases in order by clause to avoid long query 

-- can be upto 256 char long 


SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name, ' played in ', title) AS movie
-> FROM actor JOIN film_actor USING (actor_id)
-> JOIN film USING (film_id)
-> ORDER BY movie LIMIT 20

-- using entire concat function instead column alias 

mysql> SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name, ' played in ', title) AS movie
    -> FROM actor JOIN film_actor USING (actor_id)
    -> JOIN film USING (film_id)
    -> ORDER BY CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name, ' played in ', title)  LIMIT 20


 -- can not use alias in where /on /using clause  but can be used in order By/having /group by clause 

mysql> SELECT first_name AS name FROM actor WHERE name = 'ZERO CAGE';

ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'name' in 'where clause'



Table Alias  

-- can be upto 256 char long 

-- can be used in where /on and using clause 

--  if an alias has been used for a table, itâ€™s impossible to refer to that table without using its new alias

e.g. 

mysql> SELECT ac.actor_id, ac.first_name, ac.last_name, fl.title FROM
    -> actor AS ac INNER JOIN film_actor AS fla USING (actor_id)
    -> INNER JOIN film AS fl USING (film_id)
    -> WHERE film.title = 'AFFAIR PREJUDICE';

ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'film.title' in 'where clause'


-- correct query 

mysql> SELECT ac.actor_id, ac.first_name, ac.last_name, fl.title FROM
    -> actor AS ac INNER JOIN film_actor AS fla USING (actor_id)
    -> INNER JOIN film AS fl USING (film_id)
    -> WHERE fl.title = 'AFFAIR PREJUDICE';  -- use alias 'fl' instead table Name 


-- self join is possible using table alias 

-- if we need to see the table have duplicate entry of movie then we need to match movie with the title and also should not have ID 
-- since there is no duplicate movie detail in table so we wont see any result 

mysql> SELECT m1.film_id, m2.title
    -> FROM film AS m1, film AS m2
    -> WHERE m1.title = m2.title
    -> AND m1.film_id <> m2.film_id;
